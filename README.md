## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a healthcare data strategist with the curiosity of a journalist, the creativity of an artist, and the endurance of a thru-hiker. I specialize in translating complex claims data into actionable insights. My work lives at the intersection of analytics, systems thinking, and narrative clarityâ€”whether Iâ€™m building dashboards, optimizing benefit strategies, or exploring new ways to communicate health trends. I bring a thoughtful, steady presence to every project, grounded in both technical skill and human understanding.

Skills: SQL, Power BI, Tableau and Python.
