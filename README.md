## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a healthcare data strategist with the curiosity of a journalist, the creativity of an artist, and the grit of a thru-hiker. I specialize in translating complex claims data into actionable insights. My work sits at the intersection of analytics, storytelling, and systems thinkingâ€”whether Iâ€™m building dashboards, evaluating healthcare utilization trends, or optimizing benefit strategies. I bring a thoughtful, grounded approach to every project, with a deep respect for both the human impact behind the data and the structure required to make sense of it.

My skills include SQL, Power BI, Tableau and Python.
